# obey
obey - a game of rote memorization (it's simon says)

uses JavaScript and jQuery Slim.

 There's sound, but I've turned the volume down a fair bit. It's just for flair, so if you don't have sound enabled you aren't missing out on anything super vital.

## instructions:

* press the buttons in the same sequence as the cpu. if you mess up, it'll play the same sequence again.

* strict mode gives you 'one life'. mess up and you have to start all over on a new sequence.

* click 'obey' during gameplay to reset the game and start over.

* victory is achieved after 20 rounds of arduous, mentally exhausting Memorization Action
